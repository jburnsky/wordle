# Wordle

*This is simply for my own amusement and for practice playing "Wordle"*

**The real game can be found here: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/**

## create_dictionary.py

**The word list is pulled from [SUBTLEX-US](http://www.lexique.org/?page_id=241)**

Before playing, you need a dictionary of possible secret words. This is generated by running ```python3 create_dictionary.py```
- The default secret word length is 5 characters and the default minimum Zipf unigram frequency of the secret word is 4
- These can be optionally changed (e.g. ```python3 create_dictionary.py 7 3``` for 7-letter long secret words with a minumum frequency of 3)

## wordle.py

To play, navigate to the directory in the command line and enter ```python3 wordle.py```
- The default secret word length is 5 characters
- There is an optional secret-word-length argument that can be passed (e.g. ```python3 wordle.py 6``` for 6-letter secret words)
- You always get n+1 guesses where n is the number of letters in the secret word

### Known Problems

This currently does not keep track of and display the letter that you have guessed. You have to do that yourself ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
